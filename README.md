# pyspikelib

*pyspikelib* is a package for neural decoding from spike trains using time series classification approaches

## Getting Started

To get started, have a look at an example in the `notebooks` subfolder which is focused on predicting sleep vs. quiet wakefulness states of an animal from the spike trains of individual neurons in the frontal cortex. The data for this example is taken from the [fcx-1 dataset in the CRCNS repository](http://crcns.org/data-sets/fcx/fcx-1/about-fcx-1). This example of building a classifier to predict an animal state is covered in-depth in the following paper


Lazarevich, Ivan, Ilya Prokin, and Boris Gutkin. "Neural activity classification with machine learning models trained on interspike interval series data." arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.03855 (2018). available at [https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03855](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03855)

Please cite the above paper in case you are using the code in your own work.

The processed fcx-1 data from the example can be downloaded [via this link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fQKpYPHmenob692YZaG1P7YKWCYaTw19) (filesize is approximately 26 Mb).
